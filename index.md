# Ambel - A Chisel3 library for generating AMBA components
Ambel is a [Chisel3](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) library for generating AMBA components featuring an APB Control/Status Register target generator driven by a simple JSON schema for capturing register descriptions and the register address map.
## [Ambel project documentation (ScalaDocs)](latest/api/ambel)
## [Ambel coverage](coverage)
Ambel line coverage is generated by using Verilator as the simulator for the project's unit tests. HTML coverage reports are deployed to GitHub pages when CI unit tests pass.
