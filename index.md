# AMBEL - A Chisel Library for Generating AMBA Components
AMBEL is a [Chisel3](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) library for generating [AMBA](https://www.arm.com/architecture/system-architectures/amba) components featuring an APB Control/Status Register (CSR) target (an APB slave) generator driven by a simple JSON schema for capturing register descriptions and the register address map.
## [AMBEL project documentation](latest/api/ambel)
(ScalaDocs)
## [AMBEL coverage](coverage)
AMBEL line coverage is generated by using Verilator as the simulator for the project's unit tests. HTML coverage reports are deployed to GitHub pages when CI unit tests pass.
